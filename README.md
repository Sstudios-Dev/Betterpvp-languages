# BetterPvP - Minecraft Plugin with Multilingual Support

BetterPvP is a Minecraft plugin that offers multilingual support, allowing players to enjoy the experience in their preferred language. To change the plugin's language, simply follow these steps:

1. **Download the desired language file:** Look for the language file you wish to use in the downloads section of the repository.

2. **Rename the file:** Once downloaded, rename the file to the default name used by the plugin. For example, if you downloaded the `config-Ru.yml` file for Russian language, rename it to `config.yml`.

3. **Restart the server:** Restart your Minecraft server to apply the changes.

That's it! The plugin will now use the language you have selected. If you want to change the language again, simply repeat these steps with the corresponding language file.

If you have any questions or issues, feel free to contact the plugin's support team.

Thank you for using BetterPvP!
